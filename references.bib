This representation was designed to bridge the gap be- tween highly expressive "deep" representations of logical forms andmore shallow semantic encodings such as word senses and semantic relations. It preserves rich semantic content while allowing for compact ambigu- ity encoding and viable partial representations. We describe our system for semantic text processing, which has the TRIPS parser at the core, augmented with statistical preprocessing techniques and online lexical lookup. We also present an evaluation metric for the representation and use it to evaluate the performance of the TRIPS parser on the common task paragraphs. 343},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 The Author(s). The UniProt knowledgebase is a large resource of protein sequences and associated detailed annotation. The database contains over 60 million sequences, of which over half a million sequences have been curated by experts who critically review experimental and predicted data for each protein. The remainder are automatically annotated based on rule systems that rely on the expert curated knowledge. Since our last update in 2014, we have more than doubled the number of reference proteomes to 5631, giving a greater coverage of taxonomic diversity. We implemente d a pipeline to remove redundant highly similar proteomes that were causing excessive redundancy in UniProt. The initial run of this pipeline reduced the number of sequences in UniProt by 47 million. For our users interested in the accessory proteomes, we have made available sets of pan proteome sequences that cover the diversity of sequences for each species that is found in its strains and sub-strains. To help interpretation of genomic variants, we provide tracks of detailed protein information for the major genome browsers. We provide a SPARQL endpoint that allows complex queries of the more than 22 billion triples of data in UniProt (http://sparql.uniprot.org/). UniProt resources can be accessed via the website at http://www.uniprot.org/.},

abstract = {Big data are receiving an increasing attention in biomedicine and healthcare. It is therefore important to understand the reason why big data are assuming a crucial role for the biomedical informatics community. The capability of handling big data is becoming an enabler to carry out unprecedented research studies and to implement new models of healthcare delivery. Therefore, it is first necessary to deeply understand the four elements that constitute big data, namely Volume, Variety, Velocity, and Veracity, and their meaning in practice. Then, it is mandatory to understand where big data are present, and where they can be beneficially collected. There are research fields, such as translational bioinformatics, which need to rely on big data technologies to withstand the shock wave of data that is generated every day. Other areas, ranging from epidemiology to clinical care, can benefit from the exploitation of the large amounts of data that are nowadays available, from personal monitoring to primary care. However, building big data-enabled systems carries on relevant implications in terms of reproducibility of research studies and management of privacy and data access; proper actions should be taken to deal with these issues. An interesting consequence of the big data scenario is the availability of new software, methods, and tools, such as map-reduce, cloud computing, and concept drift machine learning algorithms, which will not only contribute to big data research, but may be beneficial in many biomedical informatics applications. The way forward with the big data opportunity will require properly applied engineering principles to design studies and applications, to avoid preconceptions or over-enthusiasms, to fully exploit the available technologies, and to improve data processing and data management regulations.},

abstract = {Cellular signal transduction is a complex phenomenon, which plays a central role in cell surviving and adaptation. The great amount of molecular data to date present in literature, together with the adoption of high throughput technologies, on the one hand, made available to scientists an enormous quantity of information, on the other hand, failed to provide a parallel increase in the understanding of biological events. In this context, a new discipline arose, the systems biology, aimed to manage the information with a computational modeling-based approach. In particular, the use of biological networks has allowed the making of huge progress in this field. Here we discuss two possible application of the use of biological networks to explore cell signaling: the study of the architecture of signaling systems that cooperate in determining the acquisition of a complex cellular function (as it is the case of the process of activation of spermatozoa) and the organization of a single specific signaling systems expressed by different cells in different tissues (i.e. the endocannabinoid system). In both the cases we have found that the networks follow a scale free and small world topology, likely due to the evolutionary advantage of robustness against random damages, fastness and specific of information processing, and easy navigability.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gene expression profiling and other genome-scale measurement technologies provide comprehensive information about molecular changes resulting from a chemical or genetic perturbation, or disease state. A critical challenge is the development of methods to interpret these large-scale data sets to identify specific biological mechanisms that can provide experimentally verifiable hypotheses and lead to the understanding of disease and drug action.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We present a detailed description of Reverse Causal Reasoning (RCR), a reverse engineering methodology to infer mechanistic hypotheses from molecular profiling data. This methodology requires prior knowledge in the form of small networks that causally link a key upstream controller node representing a biological mechanism to downstream measurable quantities. These small directed networks are generated from a knowledge base of literature-curated qualitative biological cause-and-effect relationships expressed as a network. The small mechanism networks are evaluated as hypotheses to explain observed differential measurements. We provide a simple implementation of this methodology, Whistle, specifically geared towards the analysis of gene expression data and using prior knowledge expressed in Biological Expression Language (BEL). We present the Whistle analyses for three transcriptomic data sets using a publically available knowledge base. The mechanisms inferred by Whistle are consistent with the expected biology for each data set.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Reverse Causal Reasoning yields mechanistic insights to the interpretation of gene expression profiling data that are distinct from and complementary to the results of analyses using ontology or pathway gene sets. This reverse engineering algorithm provides an evidence-driven approach to the development of models of disease, drug action, and drug toxicity.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The interpretation of high-throughput datasets has remained one of the central challenges of computational biology over the past decade. Furthermore, as the amount of biological knowledge increases, it becomes more and more difficult to integrate this large body of knowledge in a meaningful manner. In this article, we propose a particular solution to both of these challenges.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We integrate available biological knowledge by constructing a network of molecular interactions of a specific kind: causal interactions. The resulting causal graph can be queried to suggest molecular hypotheses that explain the variations observed in a high-throughput gene expression experiment. We show that a simple scoring function can discriminate between a large number of competing molecular hypotheses about the upstream cause of the changes observed in a gene expression profile. We then develop an analytical method for computing the statistical significance of each score. This analytical method also helps assess the effects of random or adversarial noise on the predictive power of our model.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Our results show that the causal graph we constructed from known biological literature is extremely robust to random noise and to missing or spurious information. We demonstrate the power of our causal reasoning model on two specific examples, one from a cancer dataset and the other from a cardiac hypertrophy experiment. We conclude that causal reasoning models provide a valuable addition to the biologist's toolkit for the interpretation of gene expression data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: R source code for the method is available upon request.},

abstract = {Scientific data of importance to biologists reside in a number of different data  sources, such as GenBank, GSDB, SWISS-PROT, EMBL, and OMIM, among many others. Some of these data sources are conventional databases implemented using database management systems (DBMSs) and others are structured files maintained in a number of different formats (e.g., ASN.1 and ACE). In addition, software packages such as sequence analysis packages (e.g., BLAST and FASTA) produce data and can therefore be viewed as data sources. To counter the increasing dispersion and heterogeneity of data, different approaches to integrating these data sources are appearing throughout the bioinformatics community. This paper surveys the technical challenges to integration, classifies the approaches, and critiques the available tools and methodologies.},

abstract = {The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD; http://ctdbase.org/) provides information about interactions between environmental chemicals and gene products and their relationships to diseases. Chemical-gene, chemical-disease and gene-disease interactions manually curated from the literature are integrated to generate expanded networks and predict many novel associations between different data types. CTD now contains over 15 million toxicogenomic relationships. To navigate this sea of data, we added several new features, including DiseaseComps (which finds comparable diseases that share toxicogenomic profiles), statistical scoring for inferred gene-disease and pathway-chemical relationships, filtering options for several tools to refine user analysis and our new Gene Set Enricher (which provides biological annotations that are enriched for gene sets). To improve data visualization, we added a Cytoscape Web view to our ChemComps feature, included color-coded interactions and created a 'slim list' for our MEDIC disease vocabulary (allowing diseases to be grouped for meta-analysis, visualization and better data management). CTD continues to promote interoperability with external databases by providing content and cross-links to their sites. Together, this wealth of expanded chemical-gene-disease data, combined with novel ways to analyze and view content, continues to help users generate testable hypotheses about the molecular mechanisms of environmental diseases.},

abstract = {AIMS: To compare the molecular and biologic signatures of a balanced dual peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-$\alpha$/$\gamma$ agonist, aleglitazar, with tesaglitazar (a dual PPAR-$\alpha$/$\gamma$ agonist) or a combination of pioglitazone (Pio; PPAR-$\gamma$ agonist) and fenofibrate (Feno; PPAR-$\alpha$ agonist) in human hepatocytes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Gene expression microarray profiles were obtained from primary human hepatocytes treated with EC(50)-aligned low, medium and high concentrations of the three treatments. A systems biology approach, Causal Network Modeling, was used to model the data to infer upstream molecular mechanisms that may explain the observed changes in gene expression. Aleglitazar, tesaglitazar and Pio/Feno each induced unique transcriptional signatures, despite comparable core PPAR signaling. Although all treatments inferred qualitatively similar PPAR-$\alpha$ signaling, aleglitazar was inferred to have greater effects on high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels than tesaglitazar and Pio/Feno, due to a greater number of gene expression changes in pathways related to high-density and low-density lipoprotein metabolism. Distinct transcriptional and biologic signatures were also inferred for stress responses, which appeared to be less affected by aleglitazar than the comparators. In particular, Pio/Feno was inferred to increase NFE2L2 activity, a key component of the stress response pathway, while aleglitazar had no significant effect. All treatments were inferred to decrease proliferative signaling.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Aleglitazar induces transcriptional signatures related to lipid parameters and stress responses that are unique from other dual PPAR-$\alpha$/$\gamma$ treatments. This may underlie observed favorable changes in lipid profiles in animal and clinical studies with aleglitazar and suggests a differentiated gene profile compared with other dual PPAR-$\alpha$/$\gamma$ agonist treatments.},

The rapid growth of the volume of pathway data has spurred the development of databases and computational tools to aid interpretation; however, use of these data is hampered by the current fragmentation of pathway information across many databases with incompatible formats. BioPAX, which was created through a community process, solves this problem by making pathway data substantially easier to collect, index, interpret and share. BioPAX can represent metabolic and signaling pathways, molecular and genetic interactions and gene regulation networks. Using BioPAX, millions of interactions, organized into thousands of pathways, from many organisms are available from a growing number of databases. This large amount of pathway data in a computable form will support visualization, analysis and biological discovery.},

Such complexity is reflected by the involvement of various brain regions and multiple pathways in the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases that render single drug target approaches ineffective. Particularly in the area of neurodegeneration, attention has been drawn to repurposing existing drugs with proven efficacy and safety profiles. However, there is a lack of systematic analysis of the brain chemical space to predict the feasibility of repurposing strategies. Using a mechanism-based, drug-target interaction modeling approach, we have identified promising drug candidates for repositioning. Mechanistic cause-and-effect models consolidate relevant prior knowledge on drugs, targets, and pathways from the scientific literature and integrate insights derived from experimental data. We demonstrate the power of this approach by predicting two repositioning candidates for Alzheimer's disease and one for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.},

abstract = {In the last two years the Pfam database (http://pfam.xfam.org) has undergone a substantial reorganisation to reduce the effort involved in making a release, thereby permitting more frequent releases. Arguably the most significant of these changes is that Pfam is now primarily based on the UniProtKB reference proteomes, with the counts of matched sequences and species reported on the website restricted to this smaller set. Building families on reference proteomes sequences brings greater stability, which decreases the amount of manual curation required to maintain them. It also reduces the number of sequences displayed on the website, whilst still providing access to many important model organisms. Matches to the full UniProtKB database are, however, still available and Pfam annotations for individual UniProtKB sequences can still be retrieved. Some Pfam entries (1.6{\%}) which have no matches to reference proteomes remain; we are working with UniProt to see if sequences from them can be incorporated into reference proteomes. Pfam-B, the automatically-generated supplement to Pfam, has been removed. The current release (Pfam 29.0) includes 16 295 entries and 559 clans.

abstract = {A crucial aspect of pacemaker current (Ih) function is the regulation by cyclic nucleotides. To assess the endogenous mechanisms controlling cAMP levels in the vicinity of pacemaker channels, Ih regulation by G-protein-coupled neurotransmitter receptors was studied in mouse thalamocortical neurones. Activation of beta-adrenergic receptors with (-)-isoproterenol (Iso) led to a small steady enhancement of Ih amplitude, whereas activation of GABAB receptors with (+/-)-Baclofen (Bac) reduced Ih, consistent with an up- and down-regulation of basal cAMP levels, respectively. In contrast, a transient (taudecay, approximately 200 s), supralinear up-regulation of Ih was observed upon coapplication of Iso and Bac that was larger than that observed with Iso alone. This up-regulation appeared to involve a cAMP synthesis pathway distinct from that recruited by Iso, as it was associated with a reversible acceleration in Ih activation kinetics and an occlusion of modulation by photolytically released cAMP, yet showed an 11 mV as opposed to a 6 mV positive shift in the activation curve and an at least seven-fold increase in duration. GABA, in the presence of the GABAA antagonist picrotoxin, mimicked, whereas N-ethylmaleimide, an inhibitor of Gi-proteins, blocked the up-regulation, supporting a requirement for GABAB receptor activation in the potentiation. Activation of synaptic GABAB responses via stimulation of inhibitory afferents from the nucleus reticularis potentiated Iso-induced increments in Ih, suggesting that synaptically located receptors couple positively to cAMP synthesis induced by beta-adrenergic receptors. These findings indicate that distinct pathways of cAMP synthesis target the pacemaker current and the recruitment of these may be controlled by GABAergic activity within thalamic networks.},

abstract = {BindingDB, www.bindingdb.org, is a publicly accessible database of experimental protein-small molecule interaction data. Its collection of over a million data entries derives primarily from scientific articles and, increasingly, US patents. BindingDB provides many ways to browse and search for data of interest, including an advanced search tool, which can cross searches of multiple query types, including text, chemical structure, protein sequence and numerical affinities. The PDB and PubMed provide links to data in BindingDB, and vice versa; and BindingDB provides links to pathway information, the ZINC catalog of available compounds, and other resources. The BindingDB website offers specialized tools that take advantage of its large data collection, including ones to generate hypotheses for the protein targets bound by a bioactive compound, and for the compounds bound by a new protein of known sequence; and virtual compound screening by maximal chemical similarity, binary kernel discrimination, and support vector machine methods. Specialized data sets are also available, such as binding data for hundreds of congeneric series of ligands, drawn from BindingDB and organized for use in validating drug design methods.

The core package provides data structures for representing many types of networks, or graphs, including simple graphs, directed graphs, and graphs with parallel edges and self-loops. The nodes in NetworkX graphs can be any (hashable) Python object and edges can contain arbitrary data; this flexibility makes NetworkX ideal for representing networks found in many different scientific fields. In addition to the basic data structures many graph algorithms are implemented for calculating network properties and structure measures: shortest paths, betweenness centrality, clustering, and degree distribution and many more. NetworkX can read and write various graph formats for easy exchange with existing data, and provides generators for many classic graphs and popular graph models, such as the Erdos-Renyi, Small World, and Barabasi-Albert models. The ease-of-use and flexibility of the Python programming language together with connection to the SciPy tools make NetworkX a powerful tool for scientific computations. We discuss some of our recent work studying synchronization of coupled oscillators to demonstrate how NetworkX enables research in the field of computational networks.},

We have completely aligned the ontology with the Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Foundry-recommended upper level Basic Formal Ontology. Furthermore, we have aligned our chemical classification with the classification of chemical-involving processes in the Gene Ontology (GO), and as a result of this effort, the majority of chemical-involving processes in GO are now defined in terms of the ChEBI entities that participate in them. This effort necessitated incorporating many additional biologically relevant compounds. We have incorporated additional data types including reference citations, and the species and component for metabolites.

This review examines the major milestones in epigenetics research in the context of diseases and various computational approaches developed in the last decades to unravel new epigenetic modifications. However, there are limited studies that systematically link genetic and epigenetic alterations of DNA to the aetiology of diseases. In this work, we demonstrate how disease-related epigenetic knowledge can be systematically captured and integrated with heterogeneous information into a functional context using Biological Expression Language (BEL). This novel methodology, based on BEL, enables us to integrate epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation or acetylation of histones into a specific disease network. As an example, we depict the integration of epigenetic and genetic factors in a functional context specific to Parkinson's disease (PD) and Multiple Sclerosis (MS).},

The higher order functional information is stored in the PATHWAY database, which contains graphical representations of cellular processes, such as metabolism, membrane transport, signal transduction and cell cycle. The PATHWAY database is supplemented by a set of ortholog group tables for the information about conserved subpathways (pathway motifs), which are often encoded by positionally coupled genes on the chromosome and which are especially useful in predicting gene functions. A third database in KEGG is LIGAND for the information about chemical compounds, enzyme molecules and enzymatic reactions. KEGG provides Java graphics tools for browsing genome maps, comparing two genome maps and manipulating expression maps, as well as computational tools for sequence comparison, graph comparison and path computation.

Assigning functional meanings to genes and genomes both at the molecular and higher levels is the primary objective of the KEGG database project. Molecular-level functions are stored in the KO (KEGG Orthology) database, where each KO is defined as a functional ortholog of genes and proteins. Higher-level functions are represented by networks of molecular interactions, reactions and relations in the forms of KEGG pathway maps, BRITE hierarchies and KEGG modules. In the past the KO database was developed for the purpose of defining nodes of molecular networks, but now the content has been expanded and the quality improved irrespective of whether or not the KOs appear in the three molecular network databases. The newly introduced addendum category of the GENES database is a collection of individual proteins whose functions are experimentally characterized and from which an increasing number of KOs are defined. Furthermore, the DISEASE and DRUG databases have been improved by systematic analysis of drug labels for better integration of diseases and drugs with the KEGG molecular networks.

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The discovery and development of new treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) requires a profound mechanistic understanding of the disease. Here, we propose a model-driven approach supporting the systematic identification of putative disease mechanisms. METHODS: We have created a model for AD and a corresponding model for the normal physiology of neurons using biological expression language to systematically model causal and correlative relationships between biomolecules, pathways, and clinical readouts. Through model-model comparison we identify "chains of causal relationships" that lead to new insights into putative disease mechanisms. RESULTS: Using differential analysis of our models we identified a new mechanism explaining the effect of amyloid-beta on apoptosis via both the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor, type 2 and nerve growth factor receptor branches of the neurotrophin signaling pathway. We also provide the example of a model-guided interpretation of genetic variation data for a comorbidity analysis between AD and type 2 diabetes mellitus. DISCUSSION: The two computable, literature-based models introduced here provide a powerful framework for the generation and validation of rational, testable hypotheses across disease areas.},

abstract = {The current drug discovery paradigm is long, costly, and prone to failure. For projects in early development, lack of efficacy in Phase II is a major contributor to the overall failure rate. Efficacy failures often occur from one of two major reasons: either the investigational agent did not achieve the required pharmacology or the mechanism targeted by the investigational agent did not significantly contribute to the disease in the tested patient population. The latter scenario can arise due to insufficient study power stemming from patient heterogeneity. If the subset of disease patients driven by the mechanism that is likely to respond to the drug can be identified and selected before enrollment begins, efficacy and response rates should improve. This will not only augment drug approval percentages, but will also minimize the number of patients at risk of side effects in the face of a suboptimal response to treatment. Here we describe a systems biology approach using molecular profiling data from patients at baseline for the development of predictive biomarker content to identify potential responders to a molecular targeted therapy before the drug is tested in humans. A case study is presented where a classifier to predict response to a TNF targeted therapy for ulcerative colitis is developed a priori and verified against a test set of patients where clinical outcomes are known. This approach will promote the tandem development of drugs with predictive response, patient selection biomarkers.},

abstract = {Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) represents a leading cause of acute liver failure. Although DILI can be discovered in preclinical animal toxicology studies and/or early clinical trials, some human DILI reactions, termed idiosyncratic DILI (IDILI), are less predictable, occur in a small number of individuals, and do not follow a clear dose-response relationship. The emergence of IDILI poses a critical health challenge for patients and a financial challenge for the pharmaceutical industry. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying IDILI is key to the development of models that can assess potential IDILI risk. This study used Reverse Causal Reasoning (RCR), a method to assess activation of molecular signaling pathways, on gene expression data from rats treated with IDILI or pharmacologic/chemical comparators (NON-DILI) at the maximum tolerated dose to identify mechanistic pathways underlying IDILI. Detailed molecular networks involved in mitochondrial injury, inflammation, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress were found in response to IDILI drugs but not negative controls (NON-DILI). In vitro assays assessing mitochondrial or ER function confirmed the effect of IDILI compounds on these systems. Together our work suggests that using gene expression data can aid in understanding mechanisms underlying IDILI and can guide in vitro screening for IDILI. Specifically, RCR should be considered for compounds that do not show evidence of DILI in preclinical animal studies positive for mitochondrial dysfunction and ER stress assays, especially when the therapeutic index toward projected human maximum drug plasma concentration is low.},

Many of these subnetworks exhibit co-occurring mutations across samples. These subnetworks contain dozens of genes with rare somatic mutations across multiple cancers; many of these genes have additional evidence supporting a role in cancer. By illuminating these rare combinations of mutations, pan-cancer network analyses provide a roadmap to investigate new diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities across cancer types.},

abstract = {Network-based approaches have become extremely important in systems biology to achieve a better understanding of biological mechanisms. For network representation, the Biological Expression Language (BEL) is well designed to collate findings from the scientific literature into biological network models. To facilitate encoding and biocuration of such findings in BEL, a BEL Information Extraction Workflow (BELIEF) was developed. BELIEF provides a web-based curation interface, the BELIEF Dashboard, that incorporates text mining techniques to support the biocurator in the generation of BEL networks. The underlying UIMA-based text mining pipeline (BELIEF Pipeline) uses several named entity recognition processes and rela-tionship extraction methods to detect concepts and BEL relationships in literature. The BELIEF Dashboard allows easy curation of the automatically generated BEL statements and their con-text annotations. Resulting BEL statements and their context annotations can be syntactically and semantically verified to ensure consistency in the BEL network. In summary, the work-flow supports experts in different stages of systems biology network building. Based on the BioCreative V BEL track evaluation, we show that the BELIEF Pipeline automatically extracts relationships with an F-score of 36.4{\%} and fully correct statements can be obtained with an F-score of 30.8{\%}. Participation in the BioCreative V Interactive task (IAT) track with BELIEF re-vealed a systems usability scale (SUS) of 67. Considering the complexity of the task for new users—learning BEL, working with a completely new interface, and performing complex cur-ation—a score so close to the overall SUS average highlights the usability of BELIEF.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing is a central component of human brain complexity; nonetheless, its regulatory mechanisms are still largely unclear. In this work, we describe a novel non-coding (nc) RNA (named 17A) RNA polymerase (pol) III-dependent embedded in the human G-protein-coupled receptor 51 gene (GPR51, GABA B2 receptor). The stable expression of 17A in SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cells induces the synthesis of an alternative splicing isoform that abolish GABA B2 intracellular signaling (i.e., inhibition of cAMP accumulation and activation of K(+) channels). Indeed, 17A is expressed in human brain, and we report that it is upregulated in cerebral tissues derived from Alzheimer disease patients. We demonstrate that 17A expression in neuroblastoma cells enhances the secretion of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) and the Abeta x-42/Alphabeta x-40 peptide ratio and that its synthesis is induced in response to inflammatory stimuli. These data correlate, for the first time, the activity of a novel pol III-dependent ncRNA to alternative splicing events and, possibly, to neurodegeneration induced by abnormal GABA B function. We anticipate that further analysis of pol III-dependent regulation of alternative splicing will disclose novel regulatory pathways associated to brain physiology and/or pathology.},

abstract = {In an effort to identify genes that may be important for drug-abuse liability, we mapped behavioral quantitative trait loci (bQTL) for sensitivity to the locomotor stimulant effect of methamphetamine (MA) using two mouse lines that were selectively bred for high MA-induced activity (HMACT) or low MA-induced activity (LMACT). We then examined gene expression differences between these lines in the nucleus accumbens, using 20 U74Av2 Affymetrix microarrays and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Expression differences were detected for several genes, including Casein Kinase 1 Epsilon (Csnkle), glutamate receptor, ionotropic, AMPA1 (GluR1), GABA B1 receptor (Gabbr1), and dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of 32 kDa (Darpp-32). We used the www.WebQTL.org database to identify QTL that regulate the expression of the genes identified by the microarrays (expression QTL; eQTL). This approach identified an eQTL for Csnkle on Chromosome 15 (LOD = 3.8) that comapped with a bQTL for the MA stimulation phenotype (LOD = 4.5), suggesting that a single allele may cause both traits. The chromosomal region containing this QTL has previously been associated with sensitivity to the stimulant effects of cocaine. These results suggest that selection was associated with (and likely caused) altered gene expression that is partially attributable to different frequencies of gene expression polymorphisms. Combining classical genetics with analysis of whole-genome gene expression and bioinformatic resources provides a powerful method for provisionally identifying genes that influence complex traits. The identified genes provide excellent candidates for future hypothesis-driven studies, translational genetic studies, and pharmacological interventions.},

abstract = {T he backbone of scientific computing is mostly a collection of high-perfor-mance code written in Fortran, C, and C++ that typically runs in batch mode on large systems, clusters, and supercomputers. However, over the past decade, high-level environ-ments that integrate easy-to-use interpreted lan-guages, comprehensive numerical libraries, and visualization facilities have become extremely popu-lar in this field. As hardware becomes faster, the crit-ical bottleneck in scientific computing isn't always the computer's processing time; the scientist's time is also a consideration. For this reason, systems that allow rapid algorithmic exploration, data analysis, and vi-sualization have become a staple of daily scientific work. The Interactive Data Language (IDL) and Matlab (for numerical work), and Mathematica and Maple (for work that includes symbolic manipula-tion) are well-known commercial environments of this kind. GNU Data Language, Octave, Maxima and Sage provide their open source counterparts. All these systems offer an interactive command line in which code can be run immediately, without having to go through the traditional edit/com-pile/execute cycle. This flexible style matches well the spirit of computing in a scientific context, in which determining what computations must be performed next often requires significant work. An interactive environment lets scientists look at data, test new ideas, combine algorithmic approaches, and evaluate their outcome directly. This process might lead to a final result, or it might clarify how they need to build a more static, large-scale pro-duction code. As this article shows, Python (www.python.org) is an excellent tool for such a workflow. 1 The IPython project (http://ipython.scipy.org) aims to not only provide a greatly enhanced Python shell but also facilities for interactive distributed and par-allel computing, as well as a comprehensive set of tools for building special-purpose interactive envi-ronments for scientific computing.},

abstract = {Networks are a powerful and flexible methodology for expressing biological knowledge for computation and communication. Network-encoded information can include systematic screens for molecular interactions, biological relationships curated from literature, and outputs from analyses of Big Data. NDEx, the Network Data Exchange (www.ndexbio.org), is an online commons where scientists can upload, share, and publicly distribute networks. Networks in NDEx receive globally unique accession IDs and can be stored for private use, shared in pre-publication collaboration, or released for public access. Standard and novel data formats are accommodated in a flexible storage model. Organizations can use NDEx as a distribution channel for networks they generate or curate. Developers of bioinformatic applications can store and query NDEx networks via a common programmatic interface. NDEx helps expand the role of networks in scientific discourse and facilitates the integration of networks as data in publications. It is a step toward an ecosystem in which networks bearing data, hypotheses, and findings flow easily between scientists.},

abstract = {Substantial effort in recent years has been devoted to constructing and analyzing large-scale gene and protein networks on the basis of "omic" data and literature mining. These interaction graphs provide valuable insight into the topologies of complex biological networks but are rarely context specific and cannot be used to predict the responses of cell signaling proteins to specific ligands or drugs. Conversely, traditional approaches to analyzing cell signaling are narrow in scope and cannot easily make use of network-level data. Here, we combine network analysis and functional experimentation by using a hybrid approach in which graphs are converted into simple mathematical models that can be trained against biochemical data. Specifically, we created Boolean logic models of immediate-early signaling in liver cells by training a literature-based prior knowledge network against biochemical data obtained from primary human hepatocytes and 4 hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines exposed to combinations of cytokines and small-molecule kinase inhibitors. Distinct families of models were recovered for each cell type, and these families clustered topologically into normal and diseased sets.},

Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},

@article{Vasilyev2014,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: We recently published in BMC Systems Biology an approach for calculating the perturbation amplitudes of causal network models by integrating gene differential expression data. This approach relies on the process of score aggregation, which combines the perturbations at the level of the individual network nodes into a global measure that quantifies the perturbation of the network as a whole. Such "bottom-up" aggregation relates the changes in molecular entities measured by omics technologies to systems-level phenotypes. However, the aggregation method we used is limited to a specific class of causal network models called "causally consistent", which is equivalent to the notion of balance of a signed graph used in graph theory. As a consequence of this limitation, our aggregation method cannot be used in the many relevant cases involving "causally inconsistent" network models such as those containing negative feedbacks.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nFINDINGS: In this note, we propose an algorithm called "sampling of spanning trees" (SST) that extends our published aggregation method to causally inconsistent network models by replacing the signed relationships between the network nodes by an appropriate continuous measure. The SST algorithm is based on spanning trees, which are a particular class of subgraphs used in graph theory, and on a sampling procedure leveraging the properties of specific random walks on the graph. This algorithm is applied to several cases of biological interest.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The SST algorithm provides a practical means of aggregating nodal values over causally inconsistent network models based on solid mathematical foundations. We showed its utility in systems biology, where the nodal values can be perturbation amplitudes of protein activities or gene differential expressions, while the networks can be models of cellular signaling or expression regulation. Since the SST algorithm is based on general graph-theoretical considerations, it is scalable to arbitrary graph sizes and can potentially be used for performing quantitative analyses in any context involving signed graphs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Gene-set enrichment analysis is a useful technique to help functionally characterize large gene lists, such as the results of gene expression experiments. This technique finds functionally coherent gene-sets, such as pathways, that are statistically over-represented in a given gene list. Ideally, the number of resulting sets is smaller than the number of genes in the list, thus simplifying interpretation. However, the increasing number and redundancy of gene-sets used by many current enrichment analysis software works against this ideal.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPRINCIPAL FINDINGS:To overcome gene-set redundancy and help in the interpretation of large gene lists, we developed "Enrichment Map", a network-based visualization method for gene-set enrichment results. Gene-sets are organized in a network, where each set is a node and edges represent gene overlap between sets. Automated network layout groups related gene-sets into network clusters, enabling the user to quickly identify the major enriched functional themes and more easily interpret the enrichment results.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS:Enrichment Map is a significant advance in the interpretation of enrichment analysis. Any research project that generates a list of genes can take advantage of this visualization framework. Enrichment Map is implemented as a freely available and user friendly plug-in for the Cytoscape network visualization software (http://baderlab.org/Software/EnrichmentMap/).},

After integration of somatic copy-number alterations, and clinical features specific to each cluster, we identify 12 different subtypes of medulloblastoma.

abstract = {Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, and the responsiveness of neurons to GABA can be modulated by sex steroids. To better understand how ovarian steroids influence GABAergic system in the primate brain, we evaluated the expression of genes encoding GABA receptor subunits, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and a GABA transporter in the brains of female rhesus macaques. Ovariectomized adults were subjected to a hormone replacement paradigm involving either 17$\beta$-estradiol (E), or E plus progesterone (E+P). Untreated animals served as controls. Using GeneChip{\textregistered} microarray analysis and real-time RT-PCR (qPCR), we examined gene expression differences within and between the amygdala (AMD), hippocampus (HPC) and arcuate nuclei of the medial basal hypothalamus (MBH). The results from PCR corresponded with results from representative GeneChip{\textregistered} probesets, and showed similar effects of sex steroids on GABA receptor subunit gene expression in the AMD and HPC, and a more pronounced expression than in the MBH. Exposure to E+P attenuated GAD1, GAD2 and SLC32A1 gene expression in the AMD and HPC, but not in the MBH. GABA receptor subunit gene expression was generally higher in the AMD and HPC than in the MBH, with the exception of receptor subunits $\epsilon$ and $\gamma$2. Taken together, the data demonstrate differential regulation of GABA receptor subunits and GABAergic system components in the MBH compared to the AMD and HPC of rhesus macaques. Elevated $\epsilon$ and reduced $\delta$ subunit expression in the MBH supports the hypothesis that the hypothalamic GABAergic system is resistant to the modulatory effects of sex steroids. },

@article{Whetzel2011,
abstract = {The National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO) is one of the National Centers for Biomedical Computing funded under the NIH Roadmap Initiative. Contributing to the national computing infrastructure, NCBO has developed BioPortal, a web portal that provides access to a library of biomedical ontologies and terminologies (http://bioportal.bioontology.org) via the NCBO Web services. BioPortal enables community participation in the evaluation and evolution of ontology content by providing features to add mappings between terms, to add comments linked to specific ontology terms and to provide ontology reviews. The NCBO Web services (http://www.bioontology.org/wiki/index.php/NCBO{\_}REST{\_}services) enable this functionality and provide a uniform mechanism to access ontologies from a variety of knowledge representation formats, such as Web Ontology Language (OWL) and Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) format. The Web services provide multi-layered access to the ontology content, from getting all terms in an ontology to retrieving metadata about a term. Users can easily incorporate the NCBO Web services into software applications to generate semantically aware applications and to facilitate structured data collection.},
