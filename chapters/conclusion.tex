\chapter{Conclusion and outlook}

This master's thesis was originally motivated by the desire to automatically interpret data sets and generate hypotheses using prior knowledge. While working towards that goal, it was necessary to develop an entire computational infrastructure for BEL. That infrastructure was extended with reusable components to integrate prior knowledge from other sources in order to model biology at the finest granularity possible. Next, a framework for testing the validity and robustness of those knowledge assemblies was implemented and applied to the \ac{NeuroMMSig} knowledge base. Finally, algorithms for extracting meaningful subnetworks were applied to enable schema-free and multi-modal analysis using a heat diffusion algorithm. Using this workflow, it is now possible to interpret multi-modal data sets and generate hypotheses in a truly automated fashion.
